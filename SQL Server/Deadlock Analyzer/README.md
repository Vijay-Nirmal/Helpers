# SQL Server Deadlock Analyzer üîç

**Transform hundreds of deadlock reports into actionable insights with automated pattern recognition, bulk analysis, and intelligent recommendations.**

## Description

The SQL Server Deadlock Analyzer is the ultimate solution for DBAs and developers who need to **quickly analyze SQL Server deadlock reports in bulk**. Instead of manually reviewing individual XML reports, this tool processes thousands of deadlock events simultaneously, automatically grouping unique patterns, identifying the most problematic tables and queries, and providing comprehensive overview reports with filtering and sorting capabilities.

**Key Problem Solved**: Manual deadlock analysis is time-consuming and error-prone. This tool transforms hours of manual work into minutes of automated analysis, revealing patterns and insights that would be impossible to detect when examining reports individually.

Built with ASP.NET Core 8.0 backend and vanilla JavaScript frontend, this intelligent analyzer goes beyond simple parsing to provide deep insights, fix suggestions, and comprehensive reporting that helps you understand not just what happened, but why it happened and how to prevent it.
